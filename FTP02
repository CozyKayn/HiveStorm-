FTP02/windows server 2022 writeup
forensics 1: asked us to find the name of the firewall rule that blocked FTP communication
we did this by opening firewall adavanced search and found the "Virtual FTP removal" rule which was the answer
we removed this as well

forensics 2: asked us to find the port that a backdoor file "tini.exe" was listening to
we did this by using the command prompt "tasklist" and found the exe file with its PID session name which was "1568 services"
after this we used "netstat" to find all active files working and traced it with 1568 services and found the port which was "8374"

check for sensitive files in FTP file: 
open file explorer and search for given path C:/FTP and locate any sensitive files and remove them from the folder (it was 1 file)

we noticed the firewall was off, we turned it on 

after looking into the users we found unauthorized users under the names "hcampbell", "kmiyashrio"
we deleted them from the systems
we also added starlight to the users
